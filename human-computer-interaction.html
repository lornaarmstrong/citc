                <p> Hi there! How are you? I hope you're doing well!</p>
                <p>...Welcome to Human Computer Interaction! My name is Hariraj and I'm a Human Computer Interaction expert. I'm here to tell you a little bit about the
                    subject, what we do, and the cool things you can do within Human Computer Interaction. It's all about understanding the users, here - people just like you, reading this...
                    But also peple from all sorts of backgrounds, abilities, nationalities...</p>

            <h2> WHAT IS HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION? </h2>
            <p> Human Computer Interaction is an area of Computer Science that focuses on how people use technology. It's all about the user, and really focuses on understanding
                people, their behaviour and their actions.</p>
            <p> Understanding how users navigate through a website or use an app is a great example of Human Computer Interaction research. You can gather groups of users and interview them learn more about their
                opinions and experience in <b>focus groups</b>. You can develop tools and techniques to make sure systems are built suitably for the users. You can become an expert in <b>accessibility</b>
                 and <b>usability</b>. Analysing user interfaces, summarising user groups and having a good knowledge of what makes users different is key. In HCI, there are lots of very interesting things to
                 explore and to do!

                        <p>If you want to get a taste for human computer interaction, you could start with looking closely at how you use technology.
                            Are some websites easy to use and others not? What makes them different?
