                <p> Hello there! </p>
                <p>...Welcome to Machine Learning! My name is Mahira and I work in Machine Learning. It's a really cool field and has a lot of exciting research happening, right now.
                    Read through the information on this page to get a taste of what Machine Learning is about! </p>

            <h2> WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING? </h2>
            <p>Machine Learning involves using algorithms that can improve over time, through their own experience. It's a bit like how human's can learn things - Machine Learning is about
            helping machines to learn things. It is a bit of a tricky concept to get your head around at first, but there are so many interesting applications of Machine Learning. We can
            teach computers how to play games, solve puzzles or perform tasks like sorting pictures of cats and dogs into the correct category. </p>

                        <p>Machine learning started way back in 1952, when a man called Arthur Samuel began working on the first ML algorithm, teaching computers to play games. </p>
