                <p> Hello there! </p>
                <p>... Welcome to Operating Systems! My name is Olive and I work as an Operating Systems Engineer. On this page, I'm going to give you a little insight into what the subject of
                operating systems is all about! It's a really interesting subject and it's so cool finding out more about what's going on when devices are running. </p>

            <h2> WHAT ARE OPERATING SYSTEMS? </h2>
            <p> An Operating System is the most important bit of software that runs on a computer. Common desktop operatings systems that you might have heard of are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.
            and most phones run with Android or iOS operating systems. Working on Operating Systems is really important, since they are such a key part of a device.</p>
            <p> Working with Operating Systems means you get to understand the 'behind-the-scences' of a computer or a phone and you can understand how it works.</p>
