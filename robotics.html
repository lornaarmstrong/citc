                <p>...Welcome to Machine Learning! My name is Mahira and I'm here to tell you everything there is to know about NLP...
                    well not quite! But here's a taster of this area of Computer Science. There are lots of different things to learn, cool projects and interesting jobs
                    in the NLP sector! </p>

            <h2> WHAT IS HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION? </h2>
            Natural Language Processing is a subject combines Computer Science, linguistics and artificial intelligence. Natural Language Processing researchers are
            working hard every day to find new ways of working with the human language. Natural language is just the language we use everyday - we speak, we read, we write
            and we listen.</p>

            <p>NLP is being used every day, all around us... <b>Speech recognition</b> happens when people talk to devices like Google Home, Alexa and Siri.
                Even things like <b>detecting spam</b> in your email inbox is done using NLP. Sometimes, when you're typing on a phone or into a browser, your device will
                use <b>predictive texting</b> to guess what you're tryig to type or search for.
                Websites like Google Translate help people communicate with each other all over the world and this uses a technique called <b>machine translation</b>.</p>
