                <p> Hello, thanks for swinging by the robotics page! </p>
                <p>... Welcome to Robotics! My name is Rachel and I'm here to tell you all about the field of Robotics within Computer Science. It's such a cool subject and there are so many interesting projects
                in the field. So many researchers are working on very interesting stuff, and robots of all shapes and sizes are being built. It branches Computer Science and Engineering together! Anyway, Feel
                free to explore the page to find out more.</p>

            <h2> WHAT IS ROBOTICS? </h2>
            <p>Robotics is a field combining Engineering and Computer Science. Robots can perform tasks which can be very useful, and can replace humans in doing the task. There are lots of interesting
            ethical questions about robotics, and so many examples of cool projects, research and products. In robotics, we develop machines for different environments, tasks and with different abilities.
            </p>

            <p>Robots can help solve complex problems and make tasks that humans need to do a lot easier. Examples of assistive robots include medical robots, robots that work in industry to perform key labour
            tasks, drones and even domestic robots.</p>
