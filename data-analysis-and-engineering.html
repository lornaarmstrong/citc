                <p> Hey there! Glad you've stopped by!</p>
                <p>... Welcome to Data Analysis and Engineering! I'm Dae and usually, I work as a Data Analyst. I'm here to tell you a little bit about what Data Analysis and Engineering
                    is. It's a little bit different to other areas of Comptuer Science, but it uses some of the same skills and has some very important applications. </p>

            <h2> WHAT IS DATA ANALYSIS AND ENGINEERING? </h2>
            <p>Data is around us, everywhere! Lots of companies use data to make big decisions, others use data to learn things about other people and about our world. We can look at climate
            data to understand the impact of climate change, or data about the population of the world over time. We also need data for announcing the most popular film of the year, and the Top 40 music charts
            every week. If you like sports, you'll see data being talked about by commentators and athletes - numbers from past performances, statistics... The role of data is SO important in our daily life.</p>

            <p>Data Analysis and Data Engineering is used by professionals but also by people who are just interested in what they can learn from data. There are lots of different ways to collect data, through
            surveys, questionaires, monitoring an environment, sensors... And, once you have collected the data, you can run all sorts of analysis on it to find patterns and interesting points. Data can be used in
            data visualisation, by designing charts and graphs to communicate the patterns to other people.</p>
