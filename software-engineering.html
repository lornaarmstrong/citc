                <p> Hi! I'm glad you've come to visit my page! </p>
                <p>... Welcome to Software Design and Engineering! My name is Suzi and I'm a Software Developer. It's a really cool job, but software design and engineering is
                also a great hobby and can help you make some really useful and creative programs.</p>

            <h2> WHAT IS SOFTWARE DESIGN & ENGINEERING? </h2>
            <p> Software Design and Software Engineering are subfields within Computer Science which involve programming and creating software. You use programs and software everyday and so does the world around you!
                Software is in hospitals, in schools, shops and in homes all over the globe. A software engineer is someone who designs, develops, maintains, tests and evaluates software. It often involves writing code,
                solving problems, fixing errors, writing documentation for your code, and working with other software engineers.</p>

            <p> The main stages of software development include: <b>design</b> (working out what you want to design, what features it needs, who will use it etc.), <b>development</b> (writing the code, running it, editing the code),
                <b>maintenance</b> (making sure there are no bugs and sorting them out if any occur), <b>testing</b> (running tests that show which parts of the program work as expected and which don't), and finally, <b>evaluation</b>
                (looking at the code and all of its tests and seeing what is good, bad and what could be improved).
