                <p> Hello and welcome! I'm SO glad you've decided to check out my page. </p>
                <p>... Welcome to UX / UI Design. My name is Ulli, and I should probably start by telling you what UI and UX stand for. UI stands for User Interface, whereas UX stands for
                    User Experience. The great thing about UI and UX design is that you already have some experience of your own - because you're here, using this website! This has been designed
                and ... it's a user interface! But enough on that for now.. Feel free to check out the rest of the page to find out more!</p>

            <h2> WHAT IS UI/UX DESIGN? </h2>
            <p>The field of UI/UX design is all about the user! In UI design, you get to design the interfaces that the user will interact with - this can include working on the layout of a website,
            but also working on deisgning anything that allows someone to interact with a product or service. UX, on the other hand, takes into account the user's journey. You can help design solutions to
            problems that users are experiencing, both on and off the screen.</p>

            <p>This can include making <b>sketches</b> and <b>prototypes</b>, getting feedback from users and clients and other designers, creating <b>colour schemes</b> and using <b>design theory</b>. </p>
